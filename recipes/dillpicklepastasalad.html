        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound short pasta, such as mini bowtie pasta</li><br/>
            <li>10 slices bacon, cooked crisp and crumbled, divided</li><br/>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li><br/>
            <li>2 cups chopped refrigerated dill pickles, plus 1/3 cup pickle brine, divided</li><br/>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill, plus more for garnish</li><br/>
            <li>1 cup 1/4-inch diced sharp Cheddar cheese</li><br/>
            <li>2/3 cup mayonnaise</li><br/>
            <li>2/3 cup sour cream</li><br/>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li><br/>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li><br/>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons salt and pasta to water and cook, stirring often, until pasta is al dente, 9 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water just enough to bring the pasta to lukewarm or room temperature. Drain well.</li><br/>
            <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels.</li><br/>
            <li>Add pasta to a large bowl. Reserve 1 tablespoon chopped pickles, 1 teaspoon dill, and 1 tablespoon bacon for garnish. Add cheese and remaining pickles, dill, and bacon to the pasta bowl.</li><br/>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together remaining 2 teaspoons salt with pickle brine, mayonnaise, sour cream, black pepper, and onion powder until well combined. Pour mixture over pasta mixture and toss well to coat. Transfer mixture to a serving bowl and top with reserved pickles, dill, and bacon. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve.</li><br/>
